# XGBoost-Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection

The purpose of this project is for me to demonstrate my ability to use the `XGBoost` library to be able to classify whether or not a transaction is fraudulent based off of a number of inputs.

The libraries used are:

* `Numpy`: https://numpy.org/doc/stable/ 
* `Pandas`: https://pandas.pydata.org/docs/ 
* `XGBoost`: https://xgboost.readthedocs.io/en/stable/
* `Sklearn`: https://scikit-learn.org/stable/index.html

The data set is open source and can be found at this link: https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/nelgiriyewithana/credit-card-fraud-detection-dataset-2023
